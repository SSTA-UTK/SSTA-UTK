Recovery Methods
================

There are a few typical recovery methods for amateur rockets:

=========================
Single-Bay, Single-Deploy
=========================

This method is typically used on light rockets flying to a low altitude, it consists of a single parachute deployed at apogee, this is the single-deploy component of the name.
Single-bay refers to the parachute being retained in a single bay of the airframe.

=======================
Single-Bay, Dual-Deploy
=======================

This method is quite difficult to get working.
It consists of a drogue parachute deployed at apogee and a main parachute deployed at some altitude, typically between 1,000’ – 5,000’ AGL depending on the weight and descent velocity of the rocket.
A two-parachute system is dual-deploy. Single-bay means the parachutes are stored in a single bay of the airframe. 

The difficulty that arises with a single-bay, dual deploy system is the deployment of the main parachute.
This is typically achieved with several mechanical or pyro-technic means:

A Jolly Logic is typically on small, lightweight rockets.
It is a small, relatively cheap device that prevents the main parachute from inflating.
A rubber band wraps around the parachute and is pinned into the device.
At the designated altitude a small servo motor inside the device releases the pin and allows the parachute to inflate.

Cable cutters are a pyrotechnic device that acts similar to a Jolly Logic, however they are more robust and good for higher-altitude and heavier rocket.
A zip-tie wraps around the bundled parachute and runs through the cable cutter.
Inside the device a blade, actuated with black powder or Pyrodex-P, is fired into the zip-tie, shearing it and allowing the parachute to inflate.
For redundancy you will want to put two cable-cutters in series along a zip-tie.

An ARRD retains the main parachute inside of the rocket’s airframe, preventing it from inflating.
The ARRD is mounted inside the airframe upon the same bulkhead as the base of the shock cord.
The pin of the ARRD is connected the same loop as the main parachute on the shock cord.
Upon deployment of the drogue parachute the loads are transferred down that drogue-main length of shock cord and into the ARRD, into the rocket.
As no load is passing through the main-rocket length the main parachute is not pulled out and prematurely deployed.
This is by far the most reliable method to do a single-bay, dual-deploy system on a large rocket. Read more about using an ARRD here.
These devices were first invented and produced by BlackSky, a now defunct amateur rocketry vendor.
They were then produced and sold by Rattworks until they also went defunct.
The Rattworks assembly instruction are still available here though.

======================
Dual-Bay, Dual-Deploy
======================

Like single-bay, dual-deploy, this method has a two-staged recovery with a drogue and main parachute.
The difference arises in how the parachutes are stored and deployed.
Two separate compartments of the rocket contain each parachute and they are both deployed using ejection charges.
The two compartments are typically coupled together with a coupler e-bay.
