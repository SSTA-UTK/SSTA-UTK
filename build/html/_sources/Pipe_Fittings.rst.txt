Pipe Fittings 
=============

Saying we are Rocket Scientists is a bit of a misnomer.
We are really high-pressure plumbers.
Rocket engines need fluids, and to move fluids we need plumbing, of which pipe fittings are a critical component.
This is a brief discussion on types of pipe fittings and thread standards.

==========================
National Pipe Thread (NPT)
==========================

NPT is one of the most common pipe thread standards in the US.
NPT is a tapered thread and requires a sealant to fill the gap between the crest and root of the thread, typically Teflon tape is used.
In oxygen-safe environments a oxygen-safe tape that has been cleaned of any grease needs to be used.
Krytox TS-4 is a paste which can also be used and is oxygen safe.
or temporary installations GPL-206 is acceptable as well.

Flare (AN/JIC)
==========================

Flare fittings come in many different flavors, AN/JIC will be the most common.
AN uses a 37° flare angle and Class 3 straight threads, the fitting seals mechanically between the flares of the mating fittings.
AN is commonly used in aerospace flight vehicles and are usually made of 2024 Aluminum, as such care must be taken when handling them; you can very easily round over the edges of the wrench flats. 

JIC is functionally equivalent to AN.
It is the industrial variant with has looser tolerance Class 2 threads.
These are usually Stainless steel and used on hydraulic equipment. For ground systems we use JIC fitting a lot.
They can be locally sourced from Royal Brass and Hose, who’s national warehouse is in Knoxville.

Flare fittings can also be used with flared tubing.
A nut and sleeve slip around a tube which has been flared and can be interfaced with a normal flare fitting.

Female flare fittings are usually swivels, meaning that the final rotational orientation of the fitting/tube/hose is up to the user, as opposed to NPT which has a very small range of adjustment.

Braided hoses usually have flared ends so that they don’t get twisted when tightened.

Compressed Gas Association (CGA)
================================

CGA fittings were created by the Compressed Gas Association.
They use nominal inch thread sizes and pitches, however, have varying mating geometries.
This is to prevent a CGA fitting for Acetylene from being used on an Oxygen bottle for instance.
Some gases share CGA fittings and can be interchanged, in general however they are to prevent misuse of equipment and systems with the wrong gases.
CGA fittings typically use mechanical face seals, in the case of the CGA 660 however as Teflon washer is used to seal between the flat faces of the mating fittings.

O-ring Boss (ORB)
==========================

ORB fittings are straight thread fittings which use an O-ring at the base of the threads to seal against the face of the mating fitting.
These are frequently used in the automotive industry.
