Rocket Engines
==============

There are 3 primary types of chemical rocket engines, Liquid, Solid, and Hybrid. SSTA is primarily a hybrid rocket propulsion focused organization with a growing liquids program. 

Solid motors use a solid oxidizer and fuel mixed together and cast into a grains. I don't have too much to say about this as this isn't my area.

Hybrid motors use a fluid oxidizer and a solid fuel.
The two propellants are seperated with a tank containg the oxidizer and the fuel grain being in the combustion chamber.
Oxidizer is injected into the combustion chamber and cobusts along the surface of the fuel.
Amatuer hybrid motors typically use Nitrous Oxide as the oxidizer due to its self-pressurizing properties.

Liquid engines use a fluid oxidizer and fuel. These are injected together into the combustion chamber and combusted.
